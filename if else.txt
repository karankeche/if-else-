Program 1: Write a Program to Find a Maximum between two numbers
Input: 1 2
Output: 2 is Max number between 1 & 2
program =
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Compare and find the maximum
if num1 > num2:
    max_num = num1
else:
    max_num = num2

# Output
print(f"{max_num} is the maximum number between {num1} and {num2}")
